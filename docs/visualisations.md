## Species Distribution

### Species Distribution

![Species Distribution](diagrams/01_species_distribution.svg)

Overall distribution of species detections across the study area, shown in both bar chart and pie chart formats.

## Activity Patterns

### Species Activity Patterns

![Species Activity Patterns](diagrams/02_species_activity_patterns.svg)

Activity patterns broken down by individual species, showing hourly activity for top 8 species.

## Environmental Factors

### Lighting Analysis

![Lighting Analysis](diagrams/03_lighting_analysis.svg)

Analysis of wildlife activity under different lighting conditions (bright vs dark), including species-specific day/night preferences.

### Battery Levels by Location

![Battery Levels by Location](diagrams/04_battery_levels_by_location.svg)

Battery level monitoring across all camera locations over time, showing drainage patterns, critical battery warnings, and maintenance requirements for each site.

### Location Comparison

![Location Comparison](diagrams/05_location_comparison.svg)

Comparison of wildlife activity across different camera locations, showing species diversity at each site.

### Baiting Effect Analysis

![Baiting Effect Analysis](diagrams/06_baiting_effect_analysis.svg)

Impact of baiting (human activity) on wildlife presence, showing timeline comparison and before/after analysis.

### Roe Deer - Temperature Activity

![Roe Deer Temperature Activity](diagrams/07_roe_deer_temperature_activity.svg)

Detailed temperature-activity relationship analysis for roe deer, including temperature vs time scatter, distribution patterns, hourly activity by temperature, monthly variations, and statistical summary.

### Wild Boar - Temperature Activity

![Wild Boar Temperature Activity](diagrams/08_wild_boar_temperature_activity.svg)

Detailed temperature-activity relationship analysis for wild boar, including temperature vs time scatter, distribution patterns, hourly activity by temperature, monthly variations, and statistical summary.

## Activity Timeline

### Individual Species Timelines
