# Wildlife identification and analysis

As a conservationist, hunter, and software developer I've been curious about what insights can be gained from the images taken by wildlife cameras in our local hunting area. This repo contains a collection of `python` tools for wildlife identification and statistical analysis. It is work in progress and by no means complete. Please feel free to contact the authors in case of questions or suggestions.
